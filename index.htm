		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p>To bring people together. The diverse set of students at U of I can help one another learn about each other's cultures and become more inclusive. Language is a common barrier that prevents this, and students can break that barrier by simply having a conversation with one another.</p>

		<div class="Goals">
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>To help any student improve his or her English speaking skills, for minimal cost. Anyone who signs up will be paired with another student who will help them practice English conversation in a relaxed environment.</p>
